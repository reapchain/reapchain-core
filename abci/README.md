# Application BlockChain Interface (ABCI)

Blockchains are systems for multi-master state machine replication.
**ABCI** is an interface that defines the boundary between the replication engine (the blockchain),
and the state machine (the application).
Using a socket protocol, a consensus engine running in one process
can manage an application state running in another.
