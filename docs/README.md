# Reapchain

Welcome to the Reapchain Core documentation!

Reapchain Core is a blockchain application platform; it provides the equivalent
of a web-server, database, and supporting libraries for blockchain applications
written in any programming language. Like a web-server serving web applications,
Reapchain serves blockchain applications.

More formally, Reapchain Core performs Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)
State Machine Replication (SMR) for arbitrary deterministic, finite state machines.
For more background, see [What is
Reapchain?](introduction/what-is-reapchain.md).

To get started quickly with an example application, see the [quick start guide](introduction/quick-start.md).

To learn about application development on Reapchain, see the [Application Blockchain Interface](https://github.com/reapchain/spec/tree/master/spec/abci).

For more details on using Reapchain, see the respective documentation for
[Reapchain Core](reapchain-core/), [benchmarking and monitoring](tools/), and [network deployments](networks/).
