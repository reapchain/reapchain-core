# ReapchainCore

Welcome to the ReapchainCore Core documentation!

ReapchainCore Core is a blockchain application platform; it provides the equivalent
of a web-server, database, and supporting libraries for blockchain applications
written in any programming language. Like a web-server serving web applications,
ReapchainCore serves blockchain applications.

More formally, ReapchainCore Core performs Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)
State Machine Replication (SMR) for arbitrary deterministic, finite state machines.
For more background, see [What is
ReapchainCore?](introduction/what-is-reapchain-core.md).

To get started quickly with an example application, see the [quick start guide](introduction/quick-start.md).

To learn about application development on ReapchainCore, see the [Application Blockchain Interface](https://github.com/reapchain-core/spec/tree/master/spec/abci).

For more details on using ReapchainCore, see the respective documentation for
[ReapchainCore Core](reapchain-core-core/), [benchmarking and monitoring](tools/), and [network deployments](networks/).
